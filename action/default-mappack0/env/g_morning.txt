Additional Info (just stuff I wanted to say):
  I just made this sky for fun, I never used it, and don't think I ever will (I sadly kinda stopped mapping for HL) but hope that someone will use it soon :)!
I my g_night sky sooo much that I thought that I'd make a fitting morning sky to it, but I don't think I managed that very well :(!


A Request (PLEASE READ THIS):
  If you use this sky on your map, could you please send me a version of your map (or a place where I can download it???) - you don't even have to give me credit for it! You can also use it in your MOD, no prob, but here as well, could you please mail me? I just wanna know if my sky gets used or not!!!
Thanks!


*Permission*
  Hey, you can use my sky, edit it a bit, do whatever you want but you MAY NOT declare it as your own work and MAY NOT sell it in any way without my permission!
  Other than that - just have fun :)
