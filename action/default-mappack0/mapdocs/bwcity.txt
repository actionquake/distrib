You are in a city. It's evening, closing in on the night. It's 
a cold weather, but the city warms you with its colorfull lighting. 
There has been an aggressive robbery in the bank, resulting in 
pistol fire and injures. Police is it at, but the mosquitos don't 
seem to bothered and keep circleling the garbage at the back of the 
restaurant. The bar is still opened, but without too much action. 
The whole restaurant is relying on the summer, where it's a yearly 
attractions for the visitors. If the recent accident wasn't enough, 
the whole city feels a bit torn apart. Times where better before...

A project from Beavisss and WizardExt. Took 2 weeks of hard work to 
finish. What was first going to be a pretty small map, turned in to 
a medium sized map, with lots of details and things to explore.

We are both very proud of the map and enjoyed the process of making 
it. No problems, other than the ordinary ones, this time. The 
transition between the editors (GTKRadiant and Worldcraft) worked 
flawless. A project where both inspired and motivaed each other, 
with an honest relation.

There is a new sky, but also many new textures. We hope you enjoy this 
map as much as we did making it and also will through playing it. 
Please look away from the rspeeds values this time and just have fun!
