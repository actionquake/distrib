You are in a city and it's night. The weather is cold, and so is 
the city. It isn't what it used to be. What was once an overall 
normal and peaceful place has turned into something the complete 
opposite. Gangs, drugs, abondoned houses and a police force no 
longer in control.

It features a lot of new graphics with quality textures, but also 
a lot of brush based details. There are a lot of interesting areas 
to explore - trainstation, office buildings, garage, containers, 
factory and more. Together with this there are good ambient sounds 
to add that extra feeling.

The map is fast paced, jumpfriendly and good looking. What more is 
there to want? There are a lot of different routes offering different 
scenarios - long view distances, close combat, speed...
So there are many ways to suprise and attack the enemy.

The process of making bwcity2 has been very long and frustrating, but 
also very exciting and fun. It has been ups and downs like any other 
larger project, but we are all very proud about the result.
