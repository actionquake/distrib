Comments: 	Based on the map airport. I wanted to make the map a bit more all-around. 
		Easier to navigate, better balance and improved visuals. 

		I started making it somewhere in 2010. So it has taken quite some time to finish it. 
		I have playtested it for hours with clan eyeCandy. In the end I decided to change the 
		visuals with all new textures and also some layout/geometry changes.

		So here it is, have fun! :)
