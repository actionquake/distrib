Important:            This skin is free to use by anyone in any game. 
                      I made this skin with the intent on using it for Action Quake 2 [Ie. http://action.telefragged.com/] 
                      But it can be used wherever the model is used.

Thanks:               To the guy who made the original Cop skin [Whoever you might be...] And to the Action Quake 2 team.

                      [Well, except for using is as it is when you play]
                      Then we can discuss what it is that you wanna do with the skin, and maby come up with something.

Notes:                This is an remake of an skin that already exists. Well, i liked the original so i wanted to make one 
                      that suits me eaven better.
